# üê∫ Wolves League UI

Wolves League UI is a proof of concept of a component library.

## üéØ Goals
The goal of this project is to create a component library (almost) from the ground up with these principles in mind:
- Accessibility
- Easy to Maintain/Develop
- Easy to Use
- No need for TailwindCSS in the project using this library

## üèóÔ∏è Structure
This project is a monorepo using [Turborepo]('https://turbo.build/repo') and [PNPM Workspaces]('https://pnpm.io/workspaces').

These are the packages present in the `packages` folder:
- `docs`: Storybook app to showcase and document all components
- `eslint-config`: ESLint configuration and rules to be used by all other packages
- `react`: The actual implementation of the components using React
- `tokens`: Values related to styles separated from any framework or tool so it can be reused anywhere
- `ts-config`: TypeScript configuration to be used by all other packages

## üé® Styles
Since I am not a designer, the styles applied to the components are purely based on my personal preferences, which may not align with established design guidelines.
